# ZigZagTest

Test task for ViraGames
Author of Repository: Nikita Merkotun
 
**Description:**
Need to repeat the app game
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.zigzaggame](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.zigzaggame)

**What needs to be implemented:**

- Core gameplay (control, ball movement). The control should work both in the editor and on the device.
- Endless level generation.
- Crystals and crystal counter.
- Progress counter.
- Screens: menu, ingame, pause window, level loss, settings window.
- Basic sounds.
- In the settings screen, add a cheat button toggle switch. If it is enabled, then the control of the ball is transferred to the ball itself, prohibiting the player from any actions. In this case, the ball should ideally pass through the field, changing its trajectory in time.

**What can be optionally implemented:**

- Pool of objects during level generation
- Text announcers that appear when the ball collects a crystal
- Ball skins
- Game counter

What **DO NOT** need to implement:

- Advertising
- Leaderboard
- RateUs

**Requirements:**

- Graphics should be similar to the main game. You need to find it on the Internet or use it from Unity.
- The UI of the application must be adapted to different resolutions. (9:20, 3:4, etc.)
- **Unity version 2020.3.11f is mandatory, we won't check the test version without it!**
- The result of the execution - Unity Project, should be uploaded to the git with open access!
- ** Lead time - 2 days **
